**EMIS Framework** is a unified explanatory framework centered on **energy**.

The term *EMIS* is defined as a framework name rather than a new ontological claim.  
Energy serves as the central regulatory variable, with three fundamental domains structured beneath it: **Matter (atom)**, **Information (bit)**, and **Spacetime**.

EMIS Framework does not introduce new physical laws.  
Instead, it provides a coherent interpretive structure for understanding how change, structure, and constraint interact across these four domains, allowing knowledge from different disciplines to be analyzed within a shared conceptual model.

## Goal

Like Euclidean geometry, EMIS Framework aims to construct a comprehensive theoretical structure using a small number of foundational axioms, capable of explaining how complex systems operate and evolve.

---

## Scope

The initial scope of EMIS Framework focuses on
**the social sciences**,
where systemic constraints, information flows,
and energetic costs are explicitly observable.

Over time, the framework aims to extend toward
broader disciplinary domains defined in the
**UNESCO ISCED-F (Fields of Education and Training 2013)**
classification system.

---

## Time Horizon

EMIS Framework is conceived as a
**long-term, evolving theoretical framework**,
with its structure, formulation, and scope
subject to continuous refinement through research and application.

## Clarification on Humanities and Social Sciences

> **EMIS Framework does not aim to reduce humanities to physics.**  
> **Its initial focus is on social sciences, where systemic constraints, information flow, and energetic costs are explicitly observable.**

Humanities are treated as interpretive and normative domains that interface with the framework, rather than domains to be physically reduced or mathematically constrained.

## Core Objective

The objective of EMIS Framework is fixed in a single sentence:

> **To explain how the world works,  
> not what the world is.**

This objective is descriptive rather than prescriptive.
EMIS Framework does not specify values, goals, or optimal behaviors;
it characterizes the structural constraints under which systems evolve.
