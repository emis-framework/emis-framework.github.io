## On Conceptual Legitimacy

Different sections of the framework rely on **different sources of validity**:

- **Axioms** are foundational assumptions and are not derived within the framework.
- **Theorems**:  
  Structural propositions adopted within the EMIS Framework  
  that possess cross-domain explanatory power.  

  These may be:
  - derived from EMIS axioms and core relations, or
  - inherited from established scientific or intellectual traditions
    and reinterpreted within the EMIS framework.
- **Methodologies** are analytical heuristics intended for practical application and may evolve over time.

These categories are grouped for structural coherence,  
but their epistemic status remains explicitly distinct.

## On Core Concepts and Architecture

Core concepts and architectures in EMIS represent **explanatory structures**,  
not ontological claims or fully formalized mathematical models.

They are intended to clarify how constraints, relations, and transformations operate across domains,  
rather than to redefine the fundamental nature of reality.

---

## On Disciplines and Phenomena

Sections addressing disciplines and phenomena are **interpretive applications** of EMIS.

> EMIS does not replace domain-specific theories.  
> It provides a comparative explanatory lens  
> for identifying shared constraints and structural patterns across domains.

Disciplinary analyses focus on **structural consistency**,  
while phenomenological analyses emphasize **contextual interpretation**.

---

## Scope Orientation

While EMIS is in principle applicable across the full range of disciplines defined by  
**UNESCO ISCED-F (Fields of Education and Training 2013)**,  
its **initial and primary focus** is on selected areas of the social sciences,  
where energetic costs, coordination constraints, and information flows are explicitly observable.

---

## Status Note

The EMIS Framework is conceptual and interpretive in nature.

It does not introduce new physical laws,  
but offers a unified analytical structure for understanding  
how existing laws, constraints, and systems interact across domains.
