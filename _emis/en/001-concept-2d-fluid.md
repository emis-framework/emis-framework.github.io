## Hypothesis
Social systems operate on a 2D topological surface, distinct from 3D physical space. This dimensionality shift fundamentally alters the conservation laws and force dynamics.

## 1. Momentum Conservation (vs Energy)
In 2D social networks, wealth behaves as a **Vector (Momentum)** rather than a Scalar (Energy).
- **Implication**: Financial crises are vector cancellations (collisions of opposing debt obligations), resulting in the "evaporation" of wealth, which is impossible under scalar energy conservation.

## 2. Logarithmic Gravity
In 2D, the flux through a boundary scales with $r$ (circumference), not $r^2$ (sphere).
- **Force Law**: $F \propto 1/r$.
- **Potential**: $V \propto \ln(r)$.
- **Implication**: Economic gravity is a long-range force that does not decay to zero. This explains the infinite reach of capital in globalization.

## 3. Inverse Energy Cascade
2D fluid dynamics exhibit **Inverse Energy Cascades**, where energy flows from small scales to large scales.
- **Implication**: Small market players (vortices) inevitably merge into larger structures. Monopoly is a thermodynamic necessity of 2D substrates, contrary to 3D entropy (dissipation).
