## Hypothesis
Social systems operate on a **2D Manifold** (networks/territories), distinct from 3D Euclidean space. This topological constraint fundamentally alters the realization of conservation laws.

## 1. Conservation Laws (Energy & Momentum)
Both **Energy** and **Momentum** conservation remain invariant principles ($\frac{dE}{dt}=0, \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}=0$), but their manifestation is constrained by the manifold's geometry.
- **Degrees of Freedom**: Reduced from 3 to 2.
- **Heat Capacity**: The internal energy of an ideal gas drops from $\frac{3}{2}NkT$ to $1NkT$.
- **Implication**: Social systems have **lower heat capacity** than physical 3D systems. The same energy injection causes a sharper rise in volatility (Temperature). The system is thermodynamically more responsive.

## 2. Logarithmic Gravity
In a 2D manifold, the flux through a boundary scales with $r$ (circumference), not $r^2$ (sphere).
- **Force Law**: $F \propto 1/r$.
- **Potential**: $V \propto \ln(r)$.
- **Implication**: Economic gravity is a long-range force that does not decay to zero (Confinement). This explains the infinite reach of capital in globalization.

## 3. Inverse Energy Cascade
Fluid dynamics on a 2D manifold exhibit **Inverse Energy Cascades**.
- **Mechanism**: Simultaneous conservation of Energy and **Enstrophy** forces energy to flow from small scales to large scales.
- **Implication**: Small market players (small vortices) inevitably merge into larger structures. Monopoly is a thermodynamic necessity of the 2D topology.

## 4. The Scalarization of Angular Momentum
On a 2D manifold, angular momentum degenerates from a Vector to a **Scalar (Pseudo-scalar)**.
- **Physical Consequence**: Vortex stretching is topologically impossible.
- **Social Consequence**: Social structures (Organizations) lose the degrees of freedom required for complex 3D differentiation. They are kinematically locked into a merge-only trajectory.
