---

**Under conditions of sustained operation,  
systems exhibit a bias toward lower energetic expenditure.**

This axiom does not assert that energy is the only constituent of reality.  
Rather, it states that **energy functions as a universal scarce constraint governing change.**

Because energy is scarce,  
systems that persist and replicate over time
tend to favor structural configurations
that require lower energetic costs
for operation, maintenance, and coordination.

### Explanation

Across physical, biological, cognitive, and social systems,
the emergence of stable structures is not random,
but commonly reflects **energetic advantages under given constraints**.

For example:

- Rivers, under topographical constraints, follow paths of lower resistance;
- The standardization of measurement systems reduces energetic and coordination costs in social cooperation;
- Experienced intuition, in specific contexts, replaces complex computation and reduces cognitive expenditure.

Although these phenomena belong to different domains,
within the EMIS Framework they can be understood
as manifestations of the same structural tendency:
**within a feasible solution space,
systems are more likely to retain configurations
associated with lower energetic costs.**

### Scope of Application

This axiom applies to systems that satisfy the following conditions:

- Energetic expenditure is comparable across alternative structural configurations;
- Multiple structural arrangements are available to the system;
- System persistence depends on medium- to long-term operation.

Within the EMIS Framework,
this axiom serves as one of the foundational constraints
for analyzing evolution, optimization, and structural formation.
