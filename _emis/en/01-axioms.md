---
**The evolutionary direction of all systems tends toward minimizing energy expenditure.**

This axiom does not claim that energy is the only quantity in the universe,  
but that **energy is the universal limiting resource governing change**.

Because energy is scarce, systems that persist over time are those that evolve toward configurations requiring less energy to operate, maintain, and coordinate.

### Interpretation

Across physical, biological, cognitive, and social domains,  
stable structures emerge not by chance, but by **energetic advantage**.

- Rivers flow along paths of least resistance.  
- Standardized units and measurements reduce coordination costs.  
- Experienced intuition replaces explicit calculation to lower cognitive effort.

These phenomena appear diverse, yet they share a common principle:  
they represent solutions that **reduce energetic cost under given constraints**.

### Scope

This axiom applies to systems where:
- energy expenditure can be compared,
- alternative configurations exist,
- and persistence depends on sustaining operation over time.

It serves as a foundational constraint for analyzing evolution, optimization, and structure formation within the EMIS Framework.
