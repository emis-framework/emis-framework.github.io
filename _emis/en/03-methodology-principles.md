### Principle I · Parsimony (Rule of Three)

Within the EMIS Framework, effective concepts should be expressed with minimal structure.

**Any core idea should be explainable in no more than three essential points.**

This principle reflects both cognitive efficiency and energetic constraint.  
In an environment saturated with information, systems that persist are those that minimize the energy required for understanding, communication, and coordination.

This is not merely a stylistic preference.  
It is a direct consequence of **Axiom 1**, which states that systems evolve toward reduced energy expenditure.

Parsimony in expression reduces:
- cognitive load,
- communication cost,
- and coordination friction.

In this sense, the “rule of three” is an applied form of Occam’s Razor under energetic constraints.

### Principle II · Root Cause Inquiry (The Five Whys)

Complex systems often conceal their true constraints beneath layers of symptoms.

To reveal underlying structure, EMIS adopts a principle of **iterative causal inquiry**, commonly known as the *Five Whys*.

Originating from Toyota car industrial practice, this method repeatedly asks *why* until surface explanations collapse and the system’s fundamental constraint becomes visible.

The purpose is not to mechanically stop at five questions,  
but to continue inquiry until the explanation reaches a level that is:
- mathematically expressible,
- physically constrained,
- or statistically invariant.

At this depth, the system transitions from narrative explanation to structural understanding.

These methodological principles apply to explanatory,
analytical, and problem-solving contexts.
They are not intended to evaluate aesthetic,
expressive, or purely subjective forms of human activity.

### Integration within EMIS Framework

Together, these two principles define how inquiry should proceed:

- **Parsimony** limits surface complexity.
- **Root cause inquiry** drives depth.

One prevents unnecessary expansion;  
the other prevents premature closure.

Combined, they guide investigation toward explanations that are both **energetically efficient** and **structurally fundamental**, aligning directly with the Rao Theorems and the core logic of the EMIS Framework.
