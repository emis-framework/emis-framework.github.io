# Economics Index - 20 Core Concepts

> This index does not attempt to "explain economic phenomena" in the traditional sense.
> Instead, it **replaces the underlying variable system** of economics.
>
> Switching from:  
> "Preferences, Utility, Equilibrium"
>
> To:  
> **"Energy, Structure, Time Selection"**

# Economics Index - 20 Core Vocabulary (Unified Definitions)

> **EMIS v0.2 (Physical Layer)**: Economics is about how energy is distributed, delayed, and amplified within structures.
> **EMIS v0.5 (Holographic Layer)**: Economics is a holographic projection operating on a 2D manifold, governed by JT Gravity, and obeying the statistical laws of Random Matrix Theory.

## 1. [Inflation]

* **Traditional Definition**: A sustained increase in the general price level, attributed to money supply or demand.
* **EMIS v0.2 Definition**: The decoupling of the **Token Layer** from the **Physical Energy Layer**.
* **EMIS v0.2 Pseudo-code**:
    ```python
    def is_inflation(economy):
        # Inflation = Token Increment > Physical Capture Increment
        return d(Token_Supply) / dt > d(Real_Energy_Capture) / dt
    ```
* **v0.5 (Holographic Reconstruction)**: **Geometric Expansion driven by Entropy**.
    * **L1 (Geometry)**: An increase in money supply causes the manifold volume element $\sqrt{-g}$ to expand, much like cosmic expansion stretching the ruler itself.
    * **L2 (Gravity)**: **Ricci Flow** effect. $\frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial t} \propto -R_{ij}$. Negative curvature drives spatial expansion.
    * **L3 (Holography)**: The increase in microscopic Entanglement Entropy $S$ forces the macroscopic geometry to expand to accommodate the information. Inflation is the spacetime manifestation of information overload.
* **EMIS v0.5 Pseudo-code**:
    ```python
    def is_inflation_v05(economy):
        # Inflation = Entropy-driven Metric Expansion
        return d(Metric_Volume) / dt  > d(Holographic_Complexity) / dt
    ```

## 2. [Money]

* **Traditional Definition**: A medium of exchange and store of value.
* **EMIS v0.2 Definition**: A universal **Interface** for calling/invoking energy across time and structures.
* **EMIS v0.2 Pseudo-code**:
    ```typescript
    interface Money {
        // Money is a claim on future energy
        claim_energy(amount: number, time: Future): Energy;
    }
    ```
* **v0.5 (Holographic Reconstruction)**: **The Metric Tensor ($g_{\mu\nu}$) of the 2D Manifold**.
    * **L1 (Geometry)**: Money defines the "distance" and "angle" between two points (assets) in the economic space.
    * **L3 (Holography)**: **Geometrization of Entanglement**. Money is the macroscopic geometric connectivity emerging from microscopic trust (entanglement). Without money, economic space is merely discrete dust.
* **EMIS v0.5 Pseudo-code**:
    ```typescript
    interface Money_v05 {
        // Money defines the spacetime metric
        measure_distance(Asset_A, Asset_B): Geodesic_Length;
    }
    ```

## 3. [Price]

* **Traditional Definition**: The equilibrium point of supply and demand.
* **EMIS v0.2 Definition**: The **Impedance** signal for acquiring energy within a specific structure.
* **EMIS v0.2 Pseudo-code**:
    ```python
    Price = Energy_Cost / Structural_Efficiency
    # Low structural efficiency -> High Price (High Impedance)
    ```
* **v0.5 (Holographic Reconstruction)**: **Gradient of the Gravitational Potential**.
    * **L2 (Gravity)**: High prices represent the bottom of a gravitational potential well (e.g., core assets), requiring energy expenditure to climb out of (to purchase).
    * **L4 (RMT)**: The price fluctuation spectrum obeys the **Tracy-Widom Distribution** (largest eigenvalue distribution), reflecting the scaling behavior at the system's edge.
* **EMIS v0.5 Pseudo-code**:
    ```python
    Price = Gradient(Gravitational_Potential_Phi)
    # Price is the "height" in the gravitational field
    ```

---

## 4. [Value]

* **Traditional Definition**: Utility or subjective preference.
* **EMIS v0.2 Definition**: The ability of a structure to **lower local entropy (save energy)**.
* **EMIS v0.2 Pseudo-code**:
    ```python
    Value(structure) = -d(Entropy_Local) / dt
    # Value is the rate of negentropy
    ```
* **v0.5 (Holographic Reconstruction)**: **Holographic Complexity**.
    * **L3 (Holography)**: The value of an item equals the **Computational Complexity** of its corresponding quantum state on the holographic boundary (Complexity-Volume Conjecture).
    * **Intuition**: The harder it is to generate a structure via simple algorithms (e.g., chips, art), the larger its internal "wormhole volume," and thus the higher its value.
* **EMIS v0.5 Pseudo-code**:
    ```python
    Value(structure) = Complexity(Quantum_State) ~ Volume(Wormhole)
    ```

---

## 5. [Efficiency]

* **Traditional Definition**: Optimal allocation of resources.
* **EMIS v0.2 Definition**: Ratio of functional output to energy dissipation.
* **EMIS v0.2 Pseudo-code**:
    ```python
    Efficiency = Function_Output / (Energy_Input + Heat_Loss)
    ```
* **v0.5 (Holographic Reconstruction)**: **Geodesic Deviation**.
    * **L1 (Geometry)**: Perfect efficiency = Moving along a geodesic (zero resistance).
    * **L2 (Gravity)**: Low efficiency = Deviation from the shortest path caused by gravitational waves or curvature perturbations, resulting in **Dissipation**.
* **EMIS v0.5 Pseudo-code**:
    ```python
    Efficiency = 1 - Deviation(Actual_Path, Geodesic_Path)
    ```

---

## 6. [Growth]

* **Traditional Definition**: Increase in GDP.
* **EMIS v0.2 Definition**: Improvement in the system's ability to **structure** energy flows.
* **EMIS v0.2 Pseudo-code**:
    ```python
    Growth = d(Structured_Energy_Stock) / dt
    # Growth is not just flow, but the structuring of stock
    ```
* **v0.5 (Holographic Reconstruction)**: **Change in the Euler Characteristic of the Manifold**.
    * **L1 (Geometry)**: True growth is not just volume expansion (inflation), but a **Topological Transition**. From Genus $g=0$ (simple agriculture) to $g=N$ (complex industrial network).
    * **L4 (RMT)**: Expansion of the support interval of the system's eigenvalue density (increasing the Radius $R$ of the Wigner Semicircle).
