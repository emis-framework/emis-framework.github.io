### The Holographic Principle in Finance: Entanglement as Geometry
**Project EMIS Technical Note #140**

**Status:** Theoretical Foundation / v0.5 Preview
**Topic:** AdS/CFT, Quantum Information, Systemic Risk

### 1. The Core Hypothesis: It from Qubit
Standard economics assumes the Market Geometry pre-exists. EMIS v0.5 proposes a deeper origin: **Geometry is emergent from Information Entanglement.**

We apply the **AdS/CFT Correspondence** (specifically the SYK model duality) to economics:
*   **Boundary (Quantum):** The time-series data of micro-agents. A 1D system with no gravity (The Order Book).
*   **Bulk (Gravity):** The emergent macroeconomic manifold. A 2D spacetime with gravity (The Interest Rate Curve).

### 2. The Holographic Dictionary for Economics

We establish the following isomorphisms between Quantum Gravity and Finance:

#### Law A: The Ryu-Takayanagi Formula (Asset Correlation)

The Entanglement Entropy of a boundary region equals the length of the minimal geodesic in the bulk.

$$
S_{EE} = \frac{L}{4G}
$$

*   **$S_{EE}$ (Entanglement):** Statistical Correlation (Mutual Information) between asset classes.
*   **$L$ (Geodesic Length):** The geometric "distance" in the market manifold.
*   **Insight:** During a crash, correlations spike ($S \to \text{max}$). This implies the geometric distance shrinks ($L \to 0$). **The financial universe physically contracts during a crisis.**

#### Law B: Complexity = Volume (CV Conjecture)

The computational complexity of the boundary state corresponds to the growing volume of the interior **Einstein-Rosen Bridge (ERB)**.

$$
C(t) \sim \frac{Vol(t)}{G \cdot L_{ads}}
$$

*   **$C(t)$ (Complexity):** The depth of financial derivatives (MBS, CDO). The algorithmic steps required to unwind positions.
*   **$Vol(t)$ (Bulk Volume):** The accumulation of hidden **Systemic Risk** inside an institution.
*   **Insight:** A bank's stock price (Boundary) may be stable, while its internal risk volume (Complexity) grows exponentially. This is the geometric definition of "Too Big to Fail."

#### Law C: Information Scrambling (Chaos Bound)

Information injected into the system is scrambled at a maximum rate determined by the effective temperature.

$$
\lambda_L \le 2 \pi T_{eff}
$$

*   **$\lambda_L$ (Lyapunov Exponent):** The speed of Arbitrage / Information Diffusion.
*   **$T_{eff}$ (Effective Temperature):** Market Volatility ($ \sigma^2 $).
*   **Insight:** The speed of market efficiency is physically bounded by volatility. **High volatility implies a higher limit for chaos.**

### 3. Conclusion
Gravity (Macroeconomics) is not fundamental; it is the hydrodynamics of Entanglement (Micro-transactions). **Money is the metric of a 2D manifold woven by the complexity of information.**
