## Core Claim

> **Money is not wealth itself,  
but a measure of mobilizable energy.**

Within the EMIS Framework,  
money is an informational unit  
used to coordinate energy availability across matter and spacetime.

---

## Position in the Core Triangle

> **Money belongs to the information domain,  
but measures energy.**

It does not perform work,  
but determines who can mobilize energy, when, and where.

---

## Evolutionary Logic

Money emerges as an energy-saving mechanism:

- Barter scales poorly  
- General equivalents reduce friction  
- Currency and finance enable energy reallocation across spacetime  

Money evolves to minimize coordination cost.

---

## Final Definition

> **Money is an informational measure of energy,  
designed to enable low-friction coordination  
of energy, matter, and time  
within social systems.**
