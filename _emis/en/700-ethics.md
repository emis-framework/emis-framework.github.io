    ```

## 5. [Morality]

*   **Legacy Definition**: Principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong.

    ```python
    if Action != Protocol: trigger(Guilt)
    ```

## 6. [Utilitarianism]

*   **Legacy Definition**: Maximizing utility for the greatest number.
*   **EMIS Definition**: An algorithm maximizing **Total Global Energy Surplus**, disregarding distribution topology.

    ```python
    Utilitarianism = Maximize(Sum(All_Agent_Energy))
    ```

## 7. [Deontology]

*   **Legacy Definition**: Action based on rules/duty.
*   **EMIS Definition**: **Constraint-Based Execution**. Adherence to hard-coded rules regardless of the energy outcome of specific instances.
*   **EMIS Code**:
    ```python
    Deontology = (Action in Allowed_Set) ? Execute : Block
    ```

## 8. [Altruism]

*   **Legacy Definition**: Selfless concern for others.
*   **EMIS Definition**: Investing personal energy into other nodes to increase **Network Resilience**.
*   **EMIS Code**:
    ```python
    Altruism = Transfer(My_Energy -> Other) -> Network_Stability++
    ```

## 9. [Fairness]

*   **Legacy Definition**: Impartial and just treatment.
*   **EMIS Definition**: **Symmetrical Protocol Application**. Ensuring the algorithm processes all nodes with the same rule set.
*   **EMIS Code**:
    ```python
    Fairness = (Rule(Node_A) == Rule(Node_B))
    ```

## 10. [Bias]

*   **Legacy Definition**: Prejudice in favor of or against one thing.
*   **EMIS Definition**: **Training Data Skew** causing the prediction model to deviate from ground truth physics.
*   **EMIS Code**:
    ```python
    Bias = Model_Distribution != Reality_Distribution
    ```

## 11. [Value] (Ethical)

*   **Legacy Definition**: Importance or worth.
*   **EMIS Definition**: The **Weighting Coefficient** assigned to specific variables in the system's objective function.

    ```python
    Objective = w1*Survival + w2*Growth + ...
    ```

## 12. [Responsibility]

*   **Legacy Definition**: Being accountable.
*   **EMIS Definition**: **Causal Linkage** binding an agent to the entropy consequences of their actions.

    ```python
    Responsibility = Link(Agent, Resulting_Entropy)
    ```

## 13. [Existential Risk] (X-Risk)

*   **Legacy Definition**: Risk that threatens the destruction of humanity.
*   **EMIS Definition**: A potential event where **System Entropy -> Maximum**, resulting in permanent structural deletion.
*   **EMIS Code**:
    ```python
    X_Risk = P(System_State == NULL) > 0
    ```

## 14. [Virtue]

*   **Legacy Definition**: Behavior showing high moral standards.
*   **EMIS Definition**: An agent state optimized for **Low-Friction Cooperation**.
*   **EMIS Code**:
    ```python
    Virtue = Friction_Coefficient(Agent) ≈ 0
    ```

## 15. [Corruption] (Systemic)

*   **Legacy Definition**: Impairment of integrity.
*   **EMIS Definition**: **Code Rot**. The degradation of the alignment protocol due to unauthorized overrides.
