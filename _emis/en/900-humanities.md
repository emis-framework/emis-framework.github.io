## Objective:

> To provide a physical and information-theoretic anchor for the humanities.   
> It does not negate their existence but reveals their operational mechanisms..

## One-Sentence Summary:

## One-Sentence Summary:

> The Humanities are not negated, but re-positioned by EMIS as:
> **The "Semantic User Interface (UI)" of complex physical constraints.**
>
> The backend is Energy and Math;   
the frontend is Meaning and Narrative.
