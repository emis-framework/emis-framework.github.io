## 0. Developer's Note

This is an ongoing **Experimental Framework**.
We realize that the complexity of human civilization far exceeds the description of any single model. This repository does not attempt to provide "Ultimate Truth," but tries to propose an observational perspective based on **First Principles**.

We are aware that the current logic likely contains numerous `Bugs` and cognitive blind spots. Therefore, we sincerely invite physicists, sociologists, geeks, and thinkers from all walks of life to help **Debug** (find logical loopholes) and submit your **PRs** (Pull Requests).

## 1. The Crisis

Human civilization is caught in a pincer movement of information explosion and knowledge fragmentation. Sociology, economics, political science... these disciplines are often isolated on their own islands. We possess the computing power to process massive amounts of data, yet we lack a **unified, quantifiable low-level interface** to connect this fragmented knowledge.

## 2. Core Hypothesis

**EMIS Framework** proposes a core hypothesis:

> The evolution of all social systems is essentially the continuous optimization of **energy capture and utilization efficiency** under the constraints of physical laws (such as thermodynamics).

## 3. The Core Architecture

To verify this hypothesis, we have constructed a triangular structure centered on energy:

![EMIS Core Triangle](/assets/images/10-core-triangle-en.jpg)

*   **Energy**: The **central** driving force and regulation variable of the system.
*   **Matter**: The physical carrier of change (Hardware).
*   **Information**: The arrangement protocol of change (Software).
*   **Spacetime**: The stage and boundary where change occurs.

## 4. Experimental Goals

We attempt to perform a "Code Refactoring" on humanities and social sciences:

*   **Refactoring**: Attempt to rewrite 240+ core vocabulary terms (e.g., Power, Currency, Law) as functions of E-M-I-S.
*   **Alignment**: Observe the projection of physical laws (e.g., Landauer's Principle, Entropy) in social evolution.
*   **Open Source**: This framework is completely open source. If you believe a definition in a specific discipline is incorrect, please Fork it and submit your optimized version.

## 6. How to Contribute
- Submit an Issue: If you find logical loopholes or inconsistencies.
- Pull Request: If you want to contribute a more precise definition for a specific discipline.
- Discussions: If you want to explore the application of EMIS in the real world (e.g., AI, Energy Crisis).
